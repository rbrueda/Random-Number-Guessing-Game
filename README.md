# Random-Number-Guessing-Game
A GUI platform created in Java Swing for my COMP 2120 assignment. This game allows a user to guess a random-generated number with a specified range determined by the user. The number that the user guesses is typed onto a text field and the game will check if the guessed number is correct or not by entering the "Submit" button or by pressing the "ENTER" key. 

Other features of this game are:
1. User can hover over "Submit" button which will provide hints to user if number guessed is "too high" or "too low"
2. User clicks new game once they submit preferred range and want a newly generated number.
3. User can save the game results by clicking the "Save" button which will write game credentials to text file called "game_details.txt".
4. This program uses exception handling to check if the value entered in the text field is valid, if information saved into the text file successively, and checks if a range is selected before pressing the "New Game" Button.
